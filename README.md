This is a React app boilerplate based on [this repo](https://github.com/sdisalvo-crd/react-template-1.0.0).

The original 1.0.0 version was built using React.js (React 18) + TypeScript + Webpack 5.

In this new version we have added support for SCSS, Tailwind and we have added a multi environment configuration for development and production in Webpack.
